                        Hello, my name is Chutiman Krataithong. You can call me Kai. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in physics. 
                        I was particularly interested in quantum technology. While I was still studying, I was chosen to be the student leader of the Physics Department. 
                        I was responsible for managing tasks and solving problems assigned by the faculty. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="hero--section-description">
                        Additionally, during that time, 
                        I worked part-time with the university in the student affairs department. I was responsible for documenting and reviewing documents that were sent.
